# Dashbeautiful

Beautiful interface Meraki's wonderful Dashboard API. API calls are cached for fast access.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dashbeautiful'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dashbeautiful

## Usage

```ruby
require 'dashbeautiful'

KEY = 'my-awesome-api-key'

# Get all organizations that KEY has access to, and find one by name
organizations = Dashbeautiful::Organization.all api_key: KEY
dunder = organizations.find { |org| org.name == 'Dunder Mifflin Paper Co.' }

# Find a network and get all its devices
scranton = dunder.networks.find_by(:name, 'Scranton, PA')
device_list = scranton.devices

# Calls against the API are cached, so subsequent calls are fast
schrute_farms = dunder.networks.find_by(:name, 'Schrute Farms')  # fast, 'networks' returns cached result

# You can force API access with a bang
schrute_farms = dunder.networks!.find_by(:id, '123456')  # slow, 'networks!' makes api call
```
